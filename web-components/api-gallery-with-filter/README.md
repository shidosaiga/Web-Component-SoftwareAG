# About Web Component Samples


### Development 
This project uses `Typescript` and `Webpack` to create and build one or more web components to a single JavaScript file.
 

### Setup

To download and install the packages run the install command <br>
`npm run install` 


To import the web-component into the theme, it needs to be compiled to a single JavaScript file. 
To build and generate the single JavaScript file, you need to run the build command. <br>
 `npm run build` 


The required JavaScript file will be generated as `bundle.js` and would be available under the folder `public`.

### Examples included

`api-gallery-item` 

This element renders an API. If this element is used in api gallery configuration,
the API data will be injected as part of the context.

`filter-panel-item` 

This element renders list of APIs along with the filter. This element can be injected anywhere. This will fetch the APIs  and render it using the web component `api-gallery-item`.
